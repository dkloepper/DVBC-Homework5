## Observable Trends from Analysis

- Capomulin outperformed the drugs Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo, across all three measures in this analysis, showing greater tumor volume reduction, lower instances of metastatic sites, and a higher survival rate of the test mice. It is recommended that this drug be moved to next stages of testing. 
- Ketapril perfomed similar to the placebo across all the measures for this analysis. Ketapril showed no reduction or slowing of tumor growth by volume, as compared to the placebo. Metastatic spread ended similarly to the placebo, despite trending below the placebo for most of the trial. The ending survival rate was similar to the placebo. 
- Infubinol showed no reduction or slowing of tumor growth by volume, as compared to the placebo. While not effective in reduction of volume, it did result in fewer metastatic sites, as compared to the placebo. Despite this positive note, Infubinol had the lowest survival rate, even lower than placebo. The positive effect on metastatic sites may be outweighed by the lack of volume reduction or mitigation and the lower survival rate. 

### Tumor Response over Time
![Tumor Response Plot](outputs/tumorResponse.png)

The drugs *Infubinol* and *Ketapril* performed similarly to the Placebo, while the drug *Capomulin* was the only one to show a decrease in tumor volume over the duration of the trial.

### Metastatic Spread 
![Metastatic Spread Plot](outputs/metastaticSpread.png)

All *Infubinol* and *Capomulin* showed fewer average metastatic sites as compared to the placebo over the duration of the trial. The drug *Ketapril* ended the trial with more average metastatic sites compared to the placebo, despite trending lower for most of the trial duration.

### Survial Rate
![Survival Rate Plot](outputs/survivalRate.png)

The drug *Capomulin* had a higher survival rate of the subject mice by the end of the trial, as compared to the drugs *Infubinol*, *Ketapril*, and the placebo.

### Percentage Change in Tumor Volume
![Pct Change Plot](outputs/pctTumorChange.png)

Ultimately, the drug *Capomulin* was the only drug to show an overall reduction in tumor volume from day 0 to day 45.
