## Observable Trends from Analysis

- Capomulin outperformed the drugs Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo, across all three measures showing greater tumor volume reduction, lower instances of metastatic sites, and a higher survival rate.
- Ketapril
- Infubinol

### Tumor Response over Time
![Tumor Response Plot](/outputs/tumorResponse.png)

The drugs *Infubinol* and *Ketapril* performed similarly to the Placebo, while the drug *Capomulin* was the only one to show a decrease in tumor volume over the duration of the trial.

### Metastatic Spread 
![Metastatic Spread Plot](/outputs/metastaticSpread.png)

All *Infubinol* and *Capomulin* showed fewer average metastatic sites as compared to the placebo over the duration of the trial. The drug *Ketapril* ended the trial with more average metastatic sites compared to the placebo, despite trending lower for most of the trial duration.

### Survial Rate
![Survival Rate Plot](/outputs/survivalRate.png)

The drug *Capomulin* had a higher survival rate of the subject mice by the end of the trial, as compared to the drugs *Infubinol*, *Ketapril*, and the placebo.

###Percentage Change in Tumor Volume
![Pct Change Plot](/outputs/tumorResponse.png)

Ultimately, the drug *Capomulin* was the only drug to show an overall reduction in tumor volume from day 0 to day 45.
